# Hyperledger Foundation
Hyperledger Foundation is the open, global ecosystem for enterprise-grade blockchain technologies. As a project of the Linux Foundation, Hyperledger Foundation coordinates a community of member and non member organizations, individual contributors and software developers building enterprise-grade platforms, libraries, tools and solutions for multi-party systems using blockchain, distributed ledger, and related technologies.


## Why Create Hyperledger Foundation?
Hyperledger Foundation was founded in 2015 to bring the transparency and efficiency of DLT technologies to the enterprise market, leveraging the well-proven open source software model. The high level aim is to enable solutions that connect industries, organizations, and even individuals more directly, recreating how information is shared and business is conducted. 

Hyperledger Foundation hosts a number of open source software projects that serve as the building blocks for enterprise blockchain deployments. These projects are conceived and built by the Hyperledger developer community as freely available, enterprise-grade software that vendors, end user organizations, service providers, start-ups, academics, and others can use to build and deploy blockchain networks and even commercial solutions. 

Because they are developed and governed as open source technologies, Hyperledger projects are all community led. This means that the code is written collaboratively and available for review and use by anyone. Decisions about development roadmaps and priorities are made openly and cooperatively.

## Goals

Hyperledger has the following goals:

* Create enterprise-grade, open source, distributed ledger frameworks and code bases to support business transactions
* Provide neutral, open, and community-driven infrastructure supported by technical and business governance
* Build technical communities to develop blockchain and shared ledger POCs, use cases, field trails and deployments
* Educate the public about the market opportunity for blockchain technology
* Promote our community of communities taking a toolkit approach with many platforms and frameworks

## Projects

Hyperledger Foundation incubates and promotes a [range of enterprise-grade blockchain technologies](http://hyperledger.org/projects), including distributed ledger frameworks, tools and libraries. As an umbrella project, Hyperledger Foundation encourages the re-use of common building blocks and enables rapid innovation of DLT components. The foundationâ€™s different projects progress through a standard [life cycle](https://toc.hyperledger.org/governing-documents/project-lifecycle.html).
